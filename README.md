# Pathfinding Visualizer
This is a website written in React that I wrote to showcase some different algorithms used in pathfinding. It provides a visual of the pathways that the algorithm explores before reaching the destination. The main focus of the website is the grid, where the user can place down the starting point, ending point, as well as any walls that the algorithm has to go around. A maze generation algorithm is also included, which will automatically generate a maze when clicked. Three algorithms are included, which are Dijkstra's, Breath First Search, and Depth First Search. These can be switched out with the drop down menu to the right.

## How to use
There is a github pages deployment, click [this](https://aidan-ching.github.io/pathfinding-visualizer/) for the link. Alternatively, use `npm start` in command line after cloning the repository to your system to remotely run the website on your system.
